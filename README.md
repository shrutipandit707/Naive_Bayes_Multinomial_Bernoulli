# Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes
For understanding Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes, we will start with a small example and understand the end to end process. 

To start with, let's take a few sentences and classify them in two different classes - education or cinema. Each sentence will represent one document. In real-world cases, a document be any piece of text such as an email, a news article, a book review, a tweet etc. The analysis and the algorithm involved doesnâ€™t depend on the type of document we use.

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

1. Importing and preprocessing data
2. Building the model: Multinomial Naive Bayes
3. Building the model: Bernoulli Naive Bayes

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

We will be using Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes Techniques for document classification.

- What is the background of your project?

In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes techniques. We will be understanding classifying the document in the correct class.

- Business Problem Statement:

In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes techniques. We will be understanding classifying the document in the correct class.
- What is the dataset that is being used?

The data given to us by Upgrad.
